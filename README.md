# Xylem India Hackathon - Plastic Solutions Showcase

Welcome to the official repository for the project developed by our team for the Xylem India Hackathon. Our Project serves as a comprehensive platform dedicated to addressing the prevention and collection of both Macroplastics and Microplastics, with a focus on providing practical solutions for various use cases.

## Purpose and Focus

The primary purpose of our Idea is to offer quick and accessible solutions for plastic pollution. We emphasize the need for intervention at the local level and aim to guide individuals in preventing and collecting plastic debris in nearby water bodies. The focus is on gradual, localized efforts, recognizing the importance of community-driven initiatives.

## Nature of the Project

Positioned as a quick-fix solution, our Solution provides immediate guidance to individuals uncertain about the appropriate methods for debris collection. We understand the low-priority nature of the issue and advocate for localized efforts over urgent, large-scale interventions.

## Education and Awareness

A key aspect of our project is its role in educating users about different methods available for plastic debris prevention and collection. Users are empowered to make informed decisions based on their locality's unique challenges and characteristics, fostering a sense of environmental awareness.
